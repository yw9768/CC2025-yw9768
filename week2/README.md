>> I added three shapes to my sketch, namely an ellipse, a rectangle and a triangle.
>> Coordinates make me feel very magical. You just need to leave some numbers, and the graphics can appear wherever you want. 


>> I learned ellipse(x, y, w, [h]), where x and y respectively represent the x-coordinate and y-coordinate centered on the ellipse, while w and h respectively represent the width and height of the figure. The same goes for rectangles.

>> What shocked me was the triangle. triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3), these data respectively represent the x and y coordinates of the three points of the triangle. I found the design process very interesting.
