>#### **Why Weâ€™re Not Using AI in This Course, Despite Its Obvious Benefits**
>##### *Author--Patrick Lin*

> **1.The university is a gym for your mind.**
>> I love this quote because it made me realize that going to university is actively exercising our brains. I believe the same principle applies to learning programming, that the process of understanding code and logic is precisely how we train our brains, making them stronger and stronger.

> **2.LLMs are essentially glorified mirrors, reflecting our own words and images back to us from different angles, as philosopher Shannon Vallor has argued.**
>> I believe this quote implies that LLMs do not possess true thinking capabilities, but rather fuse and reassemble content already created by humans. Applying this to programming, it may suggest that AI-generated code is not perfect or correct, potentially containing logical inconsistencies and other flaws.

> **3.In the age of AI, there is a paradox. With the accumulated knowledge of the world now at their fingertips, students need their teachers more, not less.**
>> I wholeheartedly agree with this quote. When knowledge is readily accessible, what society truly needs are good guides to lead students in synthesizing information and engaging in deep thinking. The same principle applies to programming education: while AI can effortlessly provide us with brand-new code, teachers can help us understand the rationale behind each line of code, rather than merely copying and pasting.
