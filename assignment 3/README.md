## Bloom Rings

I envision giving up pointers and numbers and letting time grow into a flower. The outer petals' pulsate 'once per second. The color of the center circle switches every minute, more like an emotional change. The background slowly shifts between day and night according to the hour, echoing the physiological rhythm. I want to express a sense of time flow and life through the entire Bloom Rings.
